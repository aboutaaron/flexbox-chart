# Flexbox Chart example

Inspired by Wilson Miner's excellent 2008 article ["Accessbile Data Visualization with Web Standards,"](http://alistapart.com/article/accessibledatavisualization) I decided to re-create his timeline chart using the new `flexbox` CSS spec.

Original timeline: [Miner's Timeline chart](http://alistapart.com/d/accessibledata/example-timeline.html)

Flexbox version: [Flexbox Timeline Chart](http://aboutaaron.com/flexbox-chart/). Resize the browser window to see flexbox in action. 

This repo is currently a work in progress. Read my accompanying article [here](#) (_coming soon_).
