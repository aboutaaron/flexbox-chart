# Flexbox Chart example

Inspired by Wilson Miner's excellent 2008 article ["Accessbile Data Visualization with Web Standards,"](http://alistapart.com/article/accessibledatavisualization) I decided to re-create his timeline chart using the new `flexbox` CSS spec.

This repo contains an example of [Miner's Timeline chart](http://alistapart.com/d/accessibledata/example-timeline.html) but with flexbox. You can see the flexbox version created in this repo [here](#). Currently a work in progress.

Read my accompanying article [here](#) (_coming soon_).
